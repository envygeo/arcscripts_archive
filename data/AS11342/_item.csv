Polygons only intersecting in one point are not redefined. The dissolve scripts, I know, dont take this into account! The way how the script works: It collects all parts of ingoing polygons that have the same field value (numeric field). After the collection is done, an overall polygon will be generated using all parts. The inner topology of structure dissolves the common boundaries automatically. You dont have to care about intersection or union - polygons that are not intersecting will stay as a part in the polygon, thus the resulting polygon is a multipart polygon so you will be asked if the parts should be exploded and written to the new shapefile or not. Compared to other analysis the result is precise.     Questions or comments? Please feel free to contact me!    *** Attention: If your numeric ID-Field differs from the default numberformat of ArcView, please insert a new line at the top of the script,  e.g: Number.SetDefFormat(""dddddddddddd"")",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10250,QDIR: Quick and Dirty Image Reference,ArcView GIS,Avenue,AS10250.zip,AS10250.zip,20-Jul-00,13-Oct-00,Public Domain,43214,6876,,,"QDIR: Quick and Dirty Image Reference is a tool for georeferencing image themes in a View using World Files.        10/13/00 UPDATED!!  I can't believe I left such a careless mistake in the install script.  It wasn't installing one of the buttons on the View GUI.  The (Fit Image to Visible Extent) option was always in the Menu, but should have been available as a button.  This is fixed now.        The .apr file is included in the download.        Requires an Active Image Theme in the View.        It provides a set of tools for moving an image theme around a view by filling the current extent, snapping to the extent of another theme, panning, resizing based on a user rectangle, and by using a user line for moving the image extent from one point to another.  Easily modifiable; Add your own method and just run the script to write the World File.        Help for individual tools can be found by holding the shift key down while clicking on each menu choice, button, or tool.  The way this extension works is entirely based on the information found in the ArcView help file for World Files.        A little more specifically, the exporting of a World File goes like this:     It works by determining the number of pixels (for X and Y) there are in the image.  Determines the geographic extent that the image is currently covering.  Calclulates the extent in map units of each pixel.  It then draws a rectangle around the upper-left pixel and calculates the centroid to use as the pixel center.  Then based on the World File instructions found in the Online help it writes the file out with the proper info.        Although I haven't tried, I imagine this extension could help in creating Image Catalogs in conjunction with the imgcat.ave ESRI sample script.  I may add that to a future version if people want it.         This extension is released under the  GNU GPL .        I hope it is useful, easy to use, and works for everyone.  Have fun! :)        Please send questions, comments, bugs, etc. to tposton1@swbell.net    ",Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
